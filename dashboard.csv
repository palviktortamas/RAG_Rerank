What is the similarity between December and April?,"According to the context provided, December and April
both end on the same day of the week. This is because December has
exactly 35 weeks (245 days) between its last day and April's first
day, which is enough time for both months to align on the same
weekday. This similarity holds true for every year, regardless of leap
years."
and what of February?,"According to the context provided, February begins on
the same day of the week as March and November in common years, and on
the same day of the week as August in leap years. Additionally,
February always ends on the same day of the week as January in common
years. In a leap year, February is the only month to begin and end on
the same day of the week. So, while February does not align with
December or April in terms of weekday endings, it does have
similarities in terms of weekday startings.
